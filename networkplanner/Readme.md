# Buildkite Golang Example

[![Add to Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/button.svg)](https://buildkite.com/new)

This repository is an example on how to test a [Golang](https://go.dev) project using Buildkite.

Interested in using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) instead? _(which is more flexible than this)_ Check

**Note:** this example assumes your Buildkite Agent machine has the Go Toolchain installed.
